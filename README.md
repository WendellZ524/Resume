# Work Experience
## Bosch (Chengdu) Information Technology Services Co., Ltd. Shanghai Branch
- **Position**: Research Scientist
- **Period**: 2022 - Present
### **Responsibilities**:
#### Ground Truth System
- **Development Perception model for Grount Truth System**: Based on PersFormer and BEVFusion, use Lidar point as 3D PE to guide the height of BEV feature map. Apply min-cost flow for matching to contrast DETR-like loss.
- **Data selection**: use Perceptre-hash, Timestamps, and IMU information to select divergence data for human annotation.
- **Annotation quality check**: use CLIP-IQA to select blurred, bad samples from the dataset. Using Grounded-SAM and other rule-based functions to check lane line labeling quality.
 
#### Setup & maintain IT Lab and department local AI training cluster
- Build up a local registry for docker images.
- Fulfill ITL network requirements & DevOps by using Ansible and playbook.
- Build a monitor based on Grafana & Prometheus.
- Build high-concurrent DFS for computer vision case by Ceph.

- **Period**ï¼š2019-2021
### **Responsibilities**:
- Unity Client Development: Build a digital twin for Toyota Infotech based on Unity Engine. Adapt LGSVL to the original project, and build the communication among SUMO's traffic flow, real-world vehicles, and Unity Engine.
- Tech Art: Optimize graphic performance for PBR rendering to ensure the Oculus Rift2 can run at least 45Hz on RTX2080.

# Other Projects
## Feature-based IR for indoor localization (2020):
- Use VGG's muti-scale contrast an image vector as key for image data, and use cosine distance to search related images in the database, use OANet to calculate the query image's orientation & position.
## Source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation for Image Segmentation (2022):
- Adapt a trained on GAT5's DeepLabV3 model to the Citysapes dataset via labels from semantic-kitty.
